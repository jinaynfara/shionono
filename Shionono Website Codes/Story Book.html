            <h2>The Importance of Shionono</h2>
                <p>Learning through different medium develops our knowledge of a language in various ways. Text books serves as materials from which we can absorb an understanding of concepts regarding a plethora of lessons. On the other hand, the social media provides us a distinct perception and awareness on how a certain language can be used depending on given situations. We can include here the TV shows that we watch as well. </p>
                 <p>Aside from the aforementioned medium of learning, there are also numerous resources on how to master our skills and techniques when learning a langauge. The provided exercises of Shionono will challenge your minds while keeping the learning simple, fun, fast, and efficient. If you want to take things on another level, you can practice yourself by undertaking activities such as refining your character writing skills and engaging in conversations in Hangul where our learning modules can provide guidance. And lastly, Shionono has a set of recommendations if you want to read story books that will take you from a complete beginner to a proficient Hangul learner </p>
                <p>Students from Rizal National Science High School's Batch 6 12-Faraday built the website Shionono. By offering easily available learning resources, the website intends to assist SPFL Korean language learners. Additionally, providing teaching materials and exercises, the website also attempts to assist teachers.
